EXPRESSIONS:
an operator followed by a list will reduce the value for the list by the operator
 y = x + 1 2 3 / 7

TODO:
How to have static constants for class? (syntax)
Reduce operator <--(
Map operator <<-
Filter operator <<=


y = x -> (list)
y = x -> (1, 2, 3)

list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
result = list <<= (x) { (x % 2) == 0 } <-+


p = Property()


Possibility:

Built-in syntax for builder pattern





100 -> fn($) -> fn2($[0] $[1])


Fraction(2, 3) -> [$.numerator, $.denominator] -> fn($[0], $[1]) * $[1]
